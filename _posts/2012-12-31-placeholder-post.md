This is simply a placeholder blog post. It includes a series of HTML markups that you should style, starting with titles (we start at `h3` as `h1` and `h2` are reserved respectively for the site tile and the title of the current page):

### Header level 3 (h3)

#### Header level 4 (h4)

When you want to quote people smarter than you 9or not):

We'll obviously need code blocks:

    function awesomeFunction(message)  {
        return console.log(message);
    }
    
    var myMessage = "A piece of code";
    awesomeFunction(myMessage);

Tables of course:

Thing | Stuff | Other stuff
--- | --- | ---
Bogus 1 | Just bogus data | A longer bogus you need to make sure looks good string.
Bogus 2 | Just bogus data | A longer bogus you need to make sure looks good string.
Bogus 3 | Just bogus data | A longer bogus you need to make sure looks good string.

There is obviously *italic* and **bold** styles, as well as unordered lists:

* One item,
* Another item,
  * A sub-item,
  * And another one,
* One last item,

And ordered lists:

1. One item,
1. Another item,
  1. A sub-item,
  1. And another one,
1. One last item,

Let's not forget [links to stuff](http://example.com) as well as pictures:
